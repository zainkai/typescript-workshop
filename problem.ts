/**
 * Problem 1 - number counter
 * Design a singleton that will return a number each time its called,
 * and each time it iterates it increments that number (0,1,2,3,..., n)
 * 
 * Follow up: 
 * Edit your singleton so that it alternates between returning a your incrementing number
 * and a letter from the alphabet
 * 
 * Example output:
 * 0, A, 1, B, 2, C,....
